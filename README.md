# FBAM logs parser

Definition of Docker image used for parsing logs generated by FBAM monitoring tool.
```log_parser.sh``` Bash script reads the logs contained in files matching the following conditions:
- The file path matches pattern stored in ```FBAM_LOGS_SOURCE_PATTERN``` env variable,
- The file name matches regex stored in ```FBAM_LOGS_SOURCE_FILE_REGEX``` variable.

The parsed logs are written to the path stored in ```FBAM_LOGS_TARGET_DIR``` directory.

The parser does the following operations:
- Logs files are grouped by ```workflowId``` and concatenated, so that a single log file contains all logs for a given ```workflowId```,
- ```workflowId``` and ```jobId``` are added to the logged JSON records.
